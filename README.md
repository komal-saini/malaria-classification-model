### What is Malaria?
Causing over 500,000 deaths worldwide each year, malaria is a severe and fatal disease transmitted through mosquitos. As the parasite is found in the red blood cells of an infected individual, malaria is often diagnosed using blood smears on microscopic slides. Unfortunately, the conventional methods used for diagnosis are quite intensive and unscalable, especially in more impoverished regions where expertise is limited. Convolutional neural networks, however, offer automated malaria detection, an extremely cheap, effective, and scalable solution.
